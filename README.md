## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Learned to add `linear-gradient` with 2 colour stops. Realised that I need to use `background` shorthand property to create gradients instead of `background-color`.

2. Practical usage of `inline-block` elements

3. Usage of `:nth-of-type()` selector

4. Set same height to flex columns using `align-items: stretch`

### Continued development

After learning JavaScript I wish to come back to this project and add the data dynamically in HTML from `data.json` file.
